// Async Vs Defer
// Async: HTML parsing and JS execution happens in parallel

// Defer: HTML parsing and JS execution happens in parallel but JS execution happens after HTML parsing

// You can put your script tag in the head tag and use defer to make sure that the JS code is executed after the HTML is parsed instead of putting the script tag at the end of the body tag
